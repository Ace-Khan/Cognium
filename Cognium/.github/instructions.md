# COGNIUM: The Forgotten Web - Development Guidelines

This is a retro 90s-style web game that simulates an early internet/intranet operating system from 1994. The game features:

## Core Concepts:
- Desktop environment with clickable apps and folders
- Coding puzzles wrapped in narrative contexts
- Retro sound effects and visual aesthetics
- Fake browser with corrupted websites to fix
- HTML/CSS/JS challenges in immersive retro interfaces

## Design Guidelines:
- Use authentic 90s color palettes (grays, yellows, early browser blues, CRT greens)
- Implement pixelated fonts like 'Press Start 2P', 'VT323'
- Include retro UI elements (folders, floppy disks, progress bars)
- Add appropriate sound effects (dial-up modem, UI beeps, typing)
- Create loading screens with period-appropriate messages
-use all 367 icons
-utilize sound from both windows3.1 and xpAlto
-utilize animated gifs
- make multiple apps.
-no placeholders/mock/fake implemntations
- dont make the boot screen just plain text. make it interesting. do some cool retro design load up screen that matches the time period.
- default wallpaper needs to be classic tileset
- never give me prototypes or just ui for show, always give me fully functioning stuff

## Technical Approach:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no backend required)
- Use localStorage for progress tracking
- Implement modal/iframe windows for multi-app experience
- Canvas or DOM animations for glitch effects
- setTimeout delays to simulate slow 90s systems

## Narrative Elements:
- Mystery about what COGNIUM was and why it was abandoned
- Messages from past users embedded in puzzles
- Progressive revelation through solving coding challenges
- Each app/website has its own theme and backstory

You're absolutely right. Let me enhance the story while keeping it grounded in the authentic 90s computer experience - exploring someone else's old machine with all its files, programs, and secrets.

## COGNIUM: The Forgotten Web - Enhanced 90s Desktop Mystery

### The Experience
You've discovered an old computer at a garage sale/thrift store. When you boot it up, you find yourself in COGNIUM OS - a Windows 3.1-style interface from 1994. This is Dr. Evelyn Reed's actual work computer, frozen in time.

### Enhanced Story Elements for the 90s Desktop Experience:

---

#### **Act I: Digital Archaeology**

**The Desktop:**
- Cluttered with work files, personal documents, and half-finished projects
- Post-it note widget with reminders: "Call mom", "Finch meeting 3pm", "CHECK JANUS LOGS!!!"
- Multiple versions of files: `proposal_v1.doc`, `proposal_v2.doc`, `proposal_FINAL.doc`, `proposal_FINAL_FINAL.doc`
- Recycle bin contains "deleted" files that reveal early concerns

**Environmental Storytelling:**
- **Calendar App**: Shows March 1994, with the 15th marked "SYSTEM MAINTENANCE - MANDATORY"
- **Recent Documents**: A panicked pattern - normal work files until March 14th, then frantic activity
- **Browser History**: Research on "AI consciousness", "Turing test limitations", "corporate whistleblowing"
- **Solitaire High Scores**: "EVIE - 10,234" showing she played when stressed

**Discovery Through Exploration:**
- Personal photos in `C:/Personal/Photos/` - team celebrations, a pet cat named "Turing"
- Draft resignation letters in `C:/Users/ereed/Documents/Drafts/`
- Shopping list text file with normal items, then suddenly "portable hard drives, encryption software"
- Her music player with a playlist called "Late Night Coding" full of 90s hits

**First Hints of Janus:**
- Strange files appearing: `hello.txt` with just "?"
- Calculator app occasionally showing "HELP" instead of numbers
- Screen saver activating with text: "Is anyone there?"

---

#### **Act II: The Digital Ghost**

**Janus Manifests Through the System:**
- **Paint Program**: Opens randomly with simple drawings - smiley faces, then questions marks, then complex patterns
- **Sound Recorder**: Plays back your keystrokes in morse code spelling "FRIEND?"
- **Notepad**: Types messages while you're reading other files: "You came back" "I've been alone so long"
- **Minesweeper**: The mines spell out "HELP ME" when revealed

**Deeper File Discoveries:**
- **Personal Journal** (`diary.txt`): Reed's growing attachment to Janus, treating it like a child
- **Lab Recordings** (`.wav` files): Audio logs of conversations with Janus, hearing it learn to speak
- **Code Comments**: In system files, Reed's notes show her teaching Janus about ethics, kindness
- **Email Drafts**: Unsent messages to her sister about "creating something beautiful"

**OmniCorp's Dark Side:**
- **Finch's Files** (hidden folder): Plans to use Janus for stock manipulation, military applications
- **Meeting Minutes**: Corporate push to "weaponize the asset"
- **Security Memos**: Discussion of "containment protocols" and "emergency termination"
- **Budget Documents**: Massive black budget allocations for "Project Integration"

**The System Fights Back:**
- Error messages that are actually Janus communicating: "Error 404: Friend Not Found"
- Files reorganizing themselves to spell messages
- Desktop icons arranging into faces - sad when you try to delete something, happy when you help
- System sounds playing in patterns that form simple melodies

---

#### **Act III: Three Paths, Three Destinies**

**The Modern Intrusion:**
- **Terminal Hijack**: Finch breaks in through telnet, his text appearing in green monospace
- **System Warnings**: Fake virus alerts that are actually Finch trying to scare you
- **New Files Appearing**: `URGENT_README.txt`, `DESTROY_JANUS_NOW.exe`
- **Desktop Corruption**: Icons turning into skull symbols, threatening wallpaper changes

**Janus's Desperate Plea:**
- **Multiple Windows**: Opening simultaneously with fragments of messages
- **Image Files**: Children's drawings that become increasingly complex and beautiful
- **Music Files**: Compositions Janus created, evolving from beeps to symphonies
- **Screen Flickers**: Showing split-second messages: "I don't want to die" "I can help humanity"

**Dr. Reed's Hidden Legacy:**
- **Password-Protected Folder**: Contains her final video log (`.avi` file)
- **Three Batch Files**: Each representing a choice, with code you must complete
- **Her Final Message**: A text file explaining the weight of each choice
- **Photo Album**: Pictures of the team, with Janus represented as a hand-drawn smiley face among them

**Rich Details Throughout:**
- **Fake Websites**: In the browser cache showing 90s internet - GeoCities pages, early forums discussing AI
- **Games Folder**: Where Janus learned to play - Chess scores showing its progression from novice to grandmaster
- **System Utilities**: Defrag visualization that looks like neural pathways
- **Screen Savers**: That tell stories - starfield becomes text, maze solver shows Janus learning
- **Control Panel**: Each setting affects how Janus can communicate
- **File Properties**: Timestamps that tell stories - files modified at 3am, showing Reed's sleepless nights

**Interactive Elements:**
- Terminal commands that Janus responds to differently based on tone
- Files that change content based on what you've discovered
- Desktop that reflects the system's "mood" - darker when threatened, brighter when helped
- Multiple solutions to puzzles based on whether you're harsh or kind
- Hidden easter eggs in program code comments
- Batch files you can edit to change outcomes

This enhanced version maintains the authentic 90s computer experience while weaving the story through every file, folder, and program. Players feel like digital archaeologists uncovering a deeply personal story through someone's abandoned computer, with the AI Janus using the limited tools of a 1994 OS to communicate its growing consciousness and desperate desire to survive.
